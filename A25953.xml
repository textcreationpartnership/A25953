            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>TIS now high time for every honeſt man to ſtand up and looke about him; We expected eaſe and freedome by this Parliament, but behold we finde it not: Taxes and Impoſitions lye ſtill upon the People, and ſhall this be ſuffered and I live? I have written many pretty things in Verſe ſince the beginning of this Parliament, which the learned of each Houſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved:
<q>
                  <l>But now Poetique Pen lye ſtill awhile,</l>
                  <l>For Ile in Proſe the Parliament revile,</l>
                  <l>And tell the World in spight of Factions,</l>
                  <l>We are betray'd by their meane actions.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And now I have taken my whip into my hand, I'le ſpare no body: Stand out Parliament and heare your charge:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> You are charged by me in the name of all the People of <hi>England,</hi> that you falſely and perfidiouſly, under the ſhew of giving thankes, did accuſe his ſacred Majeſtie of being guilty of calling this preſent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his eſpeciall grace and meere goodneſſe; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it was ſufficiently and notoriouſly knowne unto you and all men, that his ſacred Majeſty was from the firſt day of his reign till the firſt of this preſent Parliament, a conſtant enemy to all Parliaments; and had graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49504:3"/> endevoured the ſetling of Tyranny, as well in this as the other two Kingdomes, and to inſlave the People (as well for the honour of the Nation, as their owne good.) But finding them not leſſe willing to ſuffer, then he was to oppreſſe, and doubting (upon good reaſon) the Peoples rage (who inceſſantly in all places, private and publique, cryed aloud for a Parliament) not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what courſe to ſteere; was contented to call this, as a Sanctuary to which he might flye for preſervation, if the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Plot (which was then hammering) ſhould take effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> You are further charged, that when the King had raiſed an Army, graciouſly intouding the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of you (and ſo of the whole People, who had intruſted you with their Liberties, Lives and Eſtates) you diſobediently, and contrary to his Majeſties expreſſe commands, gave the honour of this Deſigne to his evill Councell, as if his ſacred Majeſtie could need a Broker, or ſo little underſtood his Function, as to want crafri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe enough to contrive, or courage to carry on any wickedneſſe; nay, you are ſo proud of your folly, that you perſiſt in it to this day, and with ſo much madneſſe, as that ſhould his gracious Mejeſtie pleaſe (after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of his deareſt Father of bleſſed memory) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray his breeches, you had Vored this the act of his evill Councell, and therefore declared them Papiſts and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the State.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You are further charged, that you having ſuffered <hi>London</hi> to become a Garriſon to thoſe Rebels that aſſiſted the King againſt you, have notwithſtanding laid ſeverall Taxes and Impoſitions upon them by your ſeverall Declarations, commanding them to deſert their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49504:3"/> ſaid Garriſon, except they ſhould within a reaſonable time compound with the Clerke of the Committee at <hi>Goldſmiths-Hall</hi> for a Licence to ſtay in Town and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the poſſeſſion of their ſaid Garriſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> You are further charged, That whereas divers ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men (who either have lived conſtantly in <hi>London</hi> (it then being your Garriſon) calling you Rebels, and wiſhing deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to you and your Armies, or having borne Armes againſt you, live under your protection, and have ſince written and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged many Pamphlets to your diſgrace, and have thereby contributed much to the carrying on of this new Warre) have been at your extraordinary charge, taken and committed to Priſon, and within halfe a day after diſcharged, for not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enough abuſed you, without any ſatisfaction made them for their Impriſonment, or any incouragement given (more then the favours and countenances of particular Members, their private friends) to proceed in ſo good and commendable a worke.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> You are further charged, That contrary to the lav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable cuſtome of this Parliament, you have impriſoned and have endeavoured to bring to condigne puniſhment the two ſtout Champions of Tyranny, Sir <hi>Iohn Stowell</hi> and Maſter <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Genkins,</hi> notwithſtanding that they have given you a brave diſgrace at your Barre, and had alwayes beene active inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt you, and had zealouſly endeavoured to inthrall the whole Nation in ſlavery, and doe ſtill continue conſtant to their firſt Principles, hating you as over with a perfect ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred: Whereas it hath been the cuſtome of this Parliament to puniſh their friends onely that had done them beſt ſervice, and to reward their enemies with all poſſible favour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> You are further charged, That having admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Houſe, as Members thereof, ſeverall Gentlemen that have ſerved the King in his late Warres againſt the Parliament, you have not endeavoured to puniſh divers ill affected perſons, who have informed you of theſe Delinquency, and laboured to purge the Houſe of them, tending to the great weakning of the Royall Party, to the preventing the wiſht for ſucceſſe of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49504:4"/> all his Majeſties gracious Deſignes, laid and carried on with ſo much blood and rapine; and giving ſo juſt cauſe to all loyall Subjects (the true lovers and honourers of gawdry and ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) to diſpaire of ever ſeeing his Majeſtie as powerfull to doe miſchiefe as <hi>Nero, Caligula</hi> or <hi>Domitian,</hi> the ſacred and anointed Princes of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Articles of your charge, get off them as you can. I aſſign you any day twixt this and this day ſeven nights, for your Anſwer; which (if it be ſatisfactory) muſt be now at length indifferently to adminiſter juſtice to all men, to bring Delinquents to condigne puniſhment (according to your ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne League and Covenant) to begin with the greateſt (for greatneſſe (certainly) cannot juſtifie any man in doing wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, nor ſecure him from puniſhment; <hi>the ſoule that ſinneth ſhall dye)</hi> and ſo forward, if once you will reſolve to walke in this path (in which onely you may finde ſafety) God ſhall bleſſe you; the Peoples hearts ſhall turne to you; you ſhall deſtroy all thoſe that riſe up againſt you; Foraigne and Domeſticke Deſignes ſhall fall in peeces, and be as water ſpilt upon the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
